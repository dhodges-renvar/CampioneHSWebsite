        a: 'A typical single-family soft wash in our area runs $250 to $600 depending on square footage, height and how much organic growth there is. Driveways are generally priced per square foot. Bundling the house, driveway and walkways in one visit is meaningfully cheaper than three separate trips because the setup is most of the cost.',

      {
        q: 'Will pressure washing damage my siding or paint?',
        a: 'High pressure absolutely can — it drives water behind siding, etches wood and strips coatings. That is why painted and coated surfaces get soft-washed: low pressure plus the right detergent, which cleans better anyway because it kills the organism instead of knocking it loose.',

      {
        q: 'How often should I wash my house in Georgia?',

        q: 'Can you remove the black streaks on my roof?',
