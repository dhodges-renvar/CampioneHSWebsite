   HERO PHOTOGRAPHY
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Background images appear in hero sections and nowhere else on this site.
   Where there is no photograph, the hero renders a built field instead — ink,
   a raked wash in the division colour, and fine grain — so a page without one
   still looks finished.

   TO ADD OR SWAP A PHOTO (one line each):
     1. Drop the file in  /public/img/hero/  named after the key below,
        e.g.  services.jpg. Crop to 16:9. Anything from 1600 px wide up is
        plenty — Next generates the smaller sizes and serves AVIF or WebP,
        so there is no need to compress it by hand first.
     2. Set `src` here.
     3. `focus` sets object-position. Use it to keep the subject out from
        behind the headline — 'right center' is usually right for a left-
        aligned hero.
     4. `dim` scales the dark scrim that guarantees the headline stays
        readable. 1 is the default. Drop toward 0.7 for an already-dark
        photograph so more of it shows; push past 1 for a bright one.
        The numbers below are set from each photo's measured brightness
        behind the headline.
